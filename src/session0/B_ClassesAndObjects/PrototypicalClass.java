/**
 * A class is a template that defines the form of an object.
 *      ◦ It specifies both the code and data of an object.
 *      ◦ The members of a class are: fields and methods.
 *      ◦ A field is sometimes called an instance variable.
 *      ◦ A class does not exist at run-time (*).
 *
 * An object is a value that exists at run-time.
 *      ◦ An object is an instance of a class.
 *      ◦ An object is created (allocated) with the new keyword.
 *      ◦ An object is automatically destroyed (deallocated) by garbage collection.
 *
 * (*): At least for the purposes of this course...
